### _PROG_ - Project Version 2
 Repository for App made with C++ to manage Nice Holidays Trip Business.

### Specs

* Interface: Console
* Navigation: Menus and submenus
* Language: English
* Data files type: txt

### Notes from Version 2

Everything about implementations and features was accomplished, from what was asked in the project's instructions.
There are just a few changes or annotations:
* At the very beginning, agency file name is not asked. It is expected that the file exists and it is named "agency.txt". If not, the program will not run. 
* Clients' and Packs' files must be in the directory also, named correctly and, if not empty, with all the info as specified in the project instructions.
* Every time user input is asked, the default info is copied to the clipboard, to speed up the process of filling all the fields - Mouse right click to paste on the console.
* For visualizing _Clients_ or _Packs Info_, general or personalized, you must go to the respective menu (_Clients Area_ or _Packs Management_) where you will find a specific option for that action.
* There are three other options in the main menu:
    - Agency Stats - Where the financial and commercial stats are presented
    - Configurations - Where Agency Info can be changed
    - Credits
* As there were some misinterpretations in some of the instructions, we decided to go for our own version of the program and its features in all those cases. It is expected that some actions are not the same, equally executed or equally ordered as mentioned in the instructions (Some parts in _Clients Area_, _Packs Management_ or _Agency Stats_ may differ from what you could understand about the project instructions). However, we did acomplished everything about the applying of the knowlegde.
